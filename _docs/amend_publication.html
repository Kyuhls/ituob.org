  - step: |
      In the left sidebar, click the “plus” button under the “Amendments” header.
      You will see a search field for publications to amend.

  - step: |
      Add the publication you want to amend to ITU OB database, if needed.
      (If that  publication already exists, skip and continue to the next step.)

      Think of an ID for the new publication, type it in search field,
      and click the “Use … as new ID” item at the end of the list below.

        <p>
          The application will allow you to enter any text as publication ID,
          but you should take care using consistent well-formatted IDs
          to ensure ITU OB database is in good shape.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Publication ID can include uppercase letters, numbers,
            and underscores.
          <li>
            If the publication is associated with an ITU recommendation,
            the ID should include recommendation code.
          <li>
            Here are some examples of well-formed publication IDs:
            <ul>
              <li><em>E212_MNC</em>
              <li><em>X121_DCC</em>
              <li><em>BUREAUFAX</em>
            </ul>
        </ul>
