<section class="intro">
  <p>
    This page provides general information about ITU OB messages,
    and editing messages works in ITU OB Editor app.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="background">
  <h3>What are messages?</h3>

  <p>
    A “message” is a unit of information inside a given ITU OB issue (a.k.a. ITU OB edition).
  <p>
    Messages can be of different types, for example:

  <ul>
    <li>Lists annexed,
    <li>Telephone service,
    <li>Amendment,
    <li>and more.
  </ul>

  <h3>How does a message look?</h3>

  <p>
    Within ITU OB Editor app, each message appears as an item on the left side of <em>Issue Editor</em> window.
    When a message is selected, <em>message editor pane</em> appears on the right side.
  <p>
    Since different messages expect different kinds of content,
    the exact way message editor looks will depend on what kind of message you select.
  <p>
    (For example, a Lists Annexed message appears as two tabs, Lists Annexed and Extra Publications,
    and is mostly auto-populated based on publications annexed to preceding OB editions.
    On the other hand, a Telephone Service message separates itself
    into a list of <em>countries and geographic areas</em>,
    and each geographic area into a list of <em>communications</em>.)
